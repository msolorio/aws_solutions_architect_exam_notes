An isolated portion of the AWS cloud to deploy resources into

## IPv4 Addressing Primer

IP
- ids computer on the internet or a network

#### Domain Name Resolution
process by which a client can request from a DNS the IP address for a domain name

domain name --> IP address

---

## Structure of IPv4 Address

#### Dotted Decimal notation
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

#### Binary Octet
- Each section between dots
- A number between 0 and 255
- The number represented by 8 zeros and ones (8 bits or 1 byte)

---

## Network and Hosts

#### Network ID
- first set of bits within an IP address
- Identifies the network on the internet
- All computers within a network share the same network ID

#### Host ID
- last set of bits in the IP address
- Identifies the computer within a network

#### Subnet Mask
- [come back to this]
- declares
  - how many bits of the IP address are allocated to the network ID
  - how many bits are allocated to the host id

For example
- a subnet mask of /24 or 255.255.255.0 means
  - the first 24 bits of the IP address are allocated for the network id
  - the last 8 bits allocated for the host id

For example
- a subnet mask of /20 means
  - first 20 bits are allocated to the network ID
  - last 12 bits are allocated to the host id
  - XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXYYYY YYYYYYYY
    - in this case
      - the X's represent the network id
      - the Y's represent the host id
    - these binary numbers can be converted to decimal to get the IP address

## Class A
- /8 bit subnet mask
  - 8 bits allocated for network id
  - 24 bits allocated for host id
- 10.0.0.0
- first assignable address - 10.0.0.1
- last assignable address - 10.255.255.254
- 16 mil usable host addresses per network

## Class B
- /16 bit subnet mask


## Class C
- /24 bit subnet mask

## Private IP Address Range
- not on the internet
- internally within company
- has 3 reserved IP ranges
  - 10.0.0.0 -> 10.255.255.255
  - 172.16.0.0 -> 172.31.255.255
  - 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.0.255

---

## Classless Interdomain Routing
- breaks away from traditional class subnet masks
/20 is an example

[see slides]

# Amazon VPC overview

Logically isolated private portion of AWS cloud within a region

VPCs cannot span across regions

subnets cannot span across across AZs

Within VPC we have full control over
- defining CIDR blocks
- settting security
- setting routing
- subnets

**VPC Router**
  - handles connections that that are leaving a subnet
  - ensures data connection is sent to correct place
  - VPC route tables configure the VPC router

Internet Gateway
- sends data out to internet - **egress** traffic
- sends data from in from internet - **ingress** traffic

Can create up to 5 vpc within a region

Each VPC has a CIDR block
- IP range for resources and subnets within VPC

Each subnet has an IP range
- fits within CIDR block of VPC
- IP range for resources within subnet

[see slide]

#### Peering Connection
- direct connection between two VPCs

#### NAT instances
- allows outbound internet connectivity from private instances
- uses an EC2 instances

#### NAT Gateway
- allows outbound internet connectivity from private instances
- managed by AWS

#### Security Groups
- instance level firewall
- attached to the network interface attached to EC2 instance

#### Network ACL
- Subnet level firewall
- like a security group for a subnet

[more VPC components to cover later]

[see slide]

## Defining VPC CIDR Blocks

### Rules for Defining CIDR Block

- size can be between /16 and /28 subnet mask

- cannot overlap with existing CIDR block that's associated with the VPC

- cannot be changed after it is created

- first 4 and last IP addresses not available for use

- AWS recommends using CIDR blocks from RFC 1918 ranges
  - allocated for private networks
  - 10.0.0.0/8 - 10.255.255.255
    - 10/8 prefix
  - 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
    - 172.16/12 prefix
  - 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
    - 192.168/16 prefix

---

### An Example 
VPC CIDR block
- 10.0.0.0/16
- using 16 bits for the network ID

Subnet IP ranges
- 10.0.1.0/24
- 10.0.2.0/24
- 10.0.3.0/24
- using 24 bits for the network ID

Available instance IPs
- 254 - 5 = 249
- 249 IPs available in each subnet

---

## Considerations

- ensure you have enough networks and hosts
- bigger CIDR blocks are better
- smaller subnets ok for most use cases
- split Highly Available resources across subnets in different AZs
- VPC peering requires non-overlapping CIDR blocks
- Avoid overlapping CIDR blocks as much as possible

---

---

## VPC Wizard

In VPC console
- Launch VPC Wizard
- Notice 4 options
  - 1). create VPC with single public subnet
    - creates /16 network with /24 subnet

  - 2). create VPC with public and private subnets
    - creates /16 network with 2 /24 subnets
    - creates NAT Gateway

  - 3). create VPC with public, private subnets and hardware VPN access
    - private subnet connected to your corporate network via VPN tunnel
  
  - 4). create VPC with only private subnet with VPN tunnel to your corporate network

---

## Exercise - Create Custom VPC

What we'll build

VPC with
- 10.0.0.0 CIDR block 
- /16 bit subnet mask
- /24 bit subnet masks for subnets
- 2 private subnets
- 2 public subnets
- Main route table
  - has route to Internet Gateway
  - automatically assigns IPv4 public addresses

In VPC console

create VPC
- use values from `custom-vpc.md`
- no IPv6 for now
- leave tenancy to default

Once created
- actions > add DNS hostnames > enable
  - assigns DNS hostnames for EC2 instances

Create Subnets
- specify custom VPC
- create 2 public in
  - AZ A
  - AZ B
- create 2 private in
  - AZ A
  - AZ B
- use designated CIDR blocks for subnets

For public subnets
- enable auto-assign IPv4 addresses

Create private route table
- select custom VPC

edit subnet associations for route table
- add private subnets

Create Internet gateway

After IG created
- attach to VPC
- Add route to IG in main route table

Create NAT gateway
- place in public subnet
- connectivity - public
- allocate elastic IP

Add entry to NAT gateway in private route table

Clean Up
- leave as is
- next exercise will build on top

---

## Exercise - Launch Instances and Test VPC

Launch Instances from the command line

Add a security group
- name publicWeb
- connect to custom VPC
- outbound traffic - all traffic / any destination
- inbound - all traffic / any destination

in `aws-cli-runinstances.md` file replace
- AMI - get ami for Amazon Linux 2
- instance type - t2.micro
- security group id (one we just created)
- subnet id for public a
- key-name - name of your key pair
- path to user data file - `file://user-data-subnet-id.txt`

run `aws configure` - paste in access key id and secret access key

run command in terminal from `aws-cli-runinstances.md` file

check instance launching in EC2 console
- label public-a

Run same command for
  - public subnet B
  - private subnet A
  - private subnet B

Visit IP for public A in browser

Connect between instances
- SSH into public a
- ping private IP of public b 
- ping private IP of private b
- curl private IP of private b
  - `curl -s <private-IP>`
  - returns HTML webpage for private b

---

## Security Groups and Network ACLs

2 different types of firewalls
- security group
- Network ACL

#### Network Access Control List - Network ACL
- applied at subnet level
- all traffic that passes through a subnet passes through **Network ACL**
- can have explicit deny rules
- stateless

#### Security Group
- applied at the instance level
  - at the network interface level of the EC2 instance
- security groups can be applied to instances in different subnets
- can only have explicit allow rules
- stateful

---

## rule table
each filewall is going to have a rule table that will specify inbound and outbound traffic

#### stateful firewall
- security group
- allows return traffic automatically
  - for a single request/response cycle
- knows that the return traffic is part of the same connection
- do not need to explicitly define rule allowing return traffic

#### stateless protocol
- Network ACL
- requires allow rules for both request and response
  - treats send and return traffic independently even if they are part of the same connection (the same request/response cycle)

---

## Security Group rules
Inbound rules
- specify allowed inbound connections initiated by other computers

Outbound rules
- specify allowed outbound connections initialited by the instance itself 

Source
- can be
  - IP address
  - IP address range
  - security group id

Support allow rules only

implicint deny rule at the end of the ruleset
  - denies traffic by default

---

## Network ACL Rules

Can have an explicit deny in rule table

When traffic enters Network ACL
- rules are checked one by one in order by number
- rule checking stops once the traffic matches a rule
  - traffic is either allowed or denied
  - the other rules are not evaluated

---

### Exercise - Configure Security Groups

Test various configurations of security groups

Create security group
- name - privateApp
- attach to custom VPC
- delete outbound rules
- inbound rules
  - HTTP from publicWeb security group
  - only allows connections from custom public security group created earlier

private instances
- unassign publicWeb security group
- assign privateApp security group

edit publicWeb custom security group for public instances
- update inbound rule to
  - add SSH traffic from anywhere
  - HTTP from anywhere

in browser connect to public instance

SSH into public instance

curl IP for private instance

---

### Exercise - Configure Network ACL

Explore existing network ACLs for custom VPC

Explore existing inbound and outbound rules

Add rule
- rule Number - 101
- HTTP from my IP
  - for example
  - 172.10.xxx.xxx/32 (/32 for exact match)
- Deny

Attemp to access the instance
- rule does not work because we are allowing all traffic first

Change custom rule to rule number 99

Test in browser
- We are denied

Remove deny rule

Clean Up
- delete
  - NAT Gateway
  - elastic IP

only need one public and one private instance for leter lessons
- delete the others with the CLI

---

## VPC Peering

Allows routing internally between 2 VPCs
- Can connect VPCs in different regions or in accounts altogether
- connection is not going out to internet
- connections are encrypted

Implementation
- routing is enabled with private IP addresses
- CIDR blicks cannot overlap for peering VPCs
- Does not support transitive routing
  - cannot pass through intermediate VPC to connect to a 3rd
  - VPCs must be connected directly

---

## Exercise - Configure VPC Peering

Create VPC peering connection between VPCs in different accounts

Overview
- Create VPCs in each account
- in security groups allow ICMP traffic from opposite VPC
- in route table for each VPC
  - add route for outbound traffic to opposite VPC

Create Prod VPC
- change to production-account
- create VPC
  - use values from `custom-vpc-prod.md` file
  - subnets
  - private route table
  - internet Gateway
- Save owner id and VPC id for VPC

Switch back to management account
- create peering connection
- select local VPC
- for VPC to peer with select
  - another account
  - account / owner id for other VPC-PROD
- VPC ID
  - add VPC id for other VPC-PROD

Switch back to production account
- accept peering connection request
- create security group
  - called VPCPEER-PROD
  - inbound rules
    - ICMP from CIDR block of VPC-MGMT (VPC from management account)
    - SSH from CIDR block of VPC-MGMT
  - outbound - all traffic

- Launch instance
  - select VPC
  - public subnet
  - add security group
    - named VPCPEER-PROD
  - create keypair if we don't have one

Switch to management account
- create security group
  - named VPCPEER-MGMT
  - select customVPC
  - inbound rules
    - ICMP from CIDR block of VPC-PROD
    - SSH from CIDR block of VPC-PROD
- add VPCPEER-MGMT security group to public a instance
  - leave publicWeb security group attached

- in Main route table add route
  - destination: CIDR block for VPC-PROD
  - target: peering connection

Switch to production-account
- in Main route table add route
  - destination: CIDR block for VPC-MGMT
  - target: peering connection

Test
- SSH into public a in management account
- ping private instance from production account
- SSH into private instance from production account
  - wont actually be able to connect because we need the key pair

Clean up
- in management account
  - terminate private instance
- in production account
  - terminate private instance

---

## VPC Endpoints

Allow us to connect privately to public services like S3

Connect direclty rather than via the internet

---

### VPC Interface Endpoint
- Attaches an elastic network interface (ENI)
  - in private subnet
- private IP attached to ENI
- the ENI can connect to many AWS services
  - API Gateway
  - CloudFormation
  - CloudWatch
  - etc...

### VPC Gateway Endpoint
- uses a route table to point traffic to the S3 Gateway endpoint
- IAM policies can be applied to endpoint
- restricted to use with S3 and Dynamo DB

---

## Service Provider Model

- A consumer in one VPC can consume a service being provided in another VPC.
- Connection is made over a private channel rather than via the internet

---

## Exercise - Create VPC Endpoint

#### What we will build
- Creating a Gateway Endpoint to connect to an S3 bucket
- add policy to S3 Gateway Endpoint
- add bucket policy to S3 bucket
- Entry in route table pointing to S3 bucket

#### Steps
In endpoints console
- create endpoint
- search for s3
- choose Gateway
- Choose custom VPC
- choose main route table of custom VPC

Route tables
- inspect main route table for custom VPC
- see route to S3

Create role to allow EC2 instance to perform S3 actions
- in IAM console
- create role
- EC2
- search permissions - `AmazonS3FullAccess`
- name role - AmazonS3FullAccess

Add role to instance

in s3 console
- create bucket
- add images to bucket

SSH into instance

see buckets
- `aws s3 ls`

see contents
- `aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name`

Test to see if we can stop connection to S3
- in Endpoint console
- update policy for endpoint
- change from Allow to Deny

Try accessing S3 from EC2 instance again
- notice we are denied access

Change Deny back to Allow

Set up Bucket Policy
- Prevent all access except from VPC Gateway Endpoint

in S3 console > in bucket > permissions > edit bucket policy

update provided `Bucket-Policy-VPCE.json`
- paste in bucket ARN
- paste in VPC Endoint id in condition

Paste in new policy and save

SSH'ed in EC2 instance
- try accessing buckets

In terminal
- `aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name`
- cannot access bucket when not VPC Endpoint

Remove the bucket
- `aws s3 rb s3://bucket-name --force`
- delete endpoint

---

## AWS Client VPN

Connect from client computer to AWS VPC via a private connection
- connection is encrypted end to end
- Can communicate with resources within a VPC using private IP addresses

within VPC
- **VPN endpoint** is connected to **elastic network interfaces** within subnets

client
- runs VPN software (not provided by AWS)
- establishes connection to VPN endpoint
  - using SSL/TLS (port 443)
  - over the internet

VPN endpoint performs **Network Address Translation**
- converts CIDR block associated with VPN client to CIDR block for VPC
- Client CIDR --> VPC CIDR

VPN Client has route table that has an entry pointing to VPN Endpoint

---

## AWS Site-to-Site VPN

Connect an onsite data center to an AWS VPC using a VPN

- Install a Virtual Private Gateway to AWS VPC
- install a customer gateway in the on-premise network
- can then establish a private connection between the two

---

## AWS VPN CloudHub

An architectural pattern

Allows
- for multiple on-premise data centers to connect to a single AWS VPC
- allows multiple on-premise data centers to connect with each other

Steps
- install **virtual private gateway** to VPC
- each on-premise data center has customer gateway
- each on-premise data center has its own ASN identifying it

[see slide]

---

## AWS Direct Connect

VPNs still run over the internet
- latency
- bandwidth contraints

Direct Connect provide a private dedicated connection to AWS data center

**AWS Direct Connection Location**
- data center with direct private connection to AWS data center

On-premise network needs to have a physical direct connection to AWS direct connection location
- often fiber optic high speed connection
- 1Gbps or 10Gbps

#### Private VIF
- virtual interface
- allows for connection to AWS resources in a VPC
- 802.1Q VLAN
- BGP session

#### Public VIF
  - allows for connection to AWS services in public space
    - CloudFront
    - S3
    - Dynamo DB
  - does not allow for connection to the internet 

#### Benefits
- private connectivity
- consistent connection
- can increase speed/latency, bandwidth/throughput

Can get lower speeds from partners in AWS Partner Network
- 50Mbps to 500Mbps

100 Gbps is featured in select locations

Direction Connections are NOT encrypted

Can use **IPSec S2S VPN** connection over VIF to encrypt data

---

## Direct Connect Gateway

Beneficial if your on-premise center needs to direct connect to multiple regions

- on-premise corporate office can create private fibre connection to a DX location
- DX Location then uses direct connect to connect to a DX Gateway
- DX Gateway can then direct connect to any region within AWS

---

## AWS Transit Gateway

Acts as a central hub for
  - connecting from on-premise center to multiple VPCs
  - connecting multiple VPCs together

TGWs can be attached to
- VPNs
- Direct Connect Gateways
- 3rd party appliances
- TGWs in other regions

[see slide]

Transit Gateway can be combined with a DX gateway
- DX Gateway connects directly to Transit gateway

---

## Using IPv6 in VPC

IPv4 addresses represent 32 bits

Using IPv4 you have ~4.3 billion addresses

To accomodate shortage of IPv4 addresses
- we use NAT
- many computers can be represented by a single entry IP

### IPv6

uses hexidecimal to represent values

xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx. xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.

- 8 separated values
- each with 4 hexidecimal characters

100 IPv6 addresses to every atom on earth

### Set up VPC

VPC has
- IPv4 CIRD block
- IPv6 CIRD block 
  - AWS assings /56 subnet mask

Subnets have /64 subnet mask

Last 2 digits in hexidecimal represent the Host id
- that is 256 available IP addresses

In Route table
- IPv6 CIDR block to route locally
- catch all IPv6 CIDR block to route to internet

all IPv6 addresses are publicly routable
- no NAT with IPv6

#### Egress-only Internet Gateway 
- allows outbound traffic but not inbound traffic
- allows for private instances

---

## VPC Flow Logs

Flow Logs caputure information about the IP traffic going to and from VPC

stored with s3 or cloudWatch

Can be set up for
- VPC
- subnet
- network interface

## Exercise - VPC Flow Logs

launch instance in public subnet
- give user data
- security group
  - SSH, HTTP

Create log Group
- in cloudWatch console
- create log group
- retention settings
  - 5 days (logs removed after 5 days)

Create role for creating and updating logs
- In IAM console
- create role
- name - flow-logs-cloudwatch

- Add inline policy
  - copy policy from `vpc-flow-logs.json`
  - paste in policy

- Edit trust relationship
  - set principal service to - `vpc-flow-logs.amazonaws.com`

Create Flow Log
- in network interface console
- flow logs > create flow log
- all traffic
- 1 minute aggregation interval
- send to CloudWatch logs
- set destination log group - log group we created
- add IAM role we created

Connect to instance

for instance
- temporary disable SSH inbound

Attempt to connect via SSH and should fail

In cloudWatch console
- select log group
- select eni from log stream
- inspect logs with information
  - view successful connections and unsuccessful connections

clean up
- terminate instance
