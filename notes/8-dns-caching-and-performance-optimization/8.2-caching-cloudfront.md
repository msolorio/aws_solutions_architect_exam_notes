## CloudFront Origins and Distribution

### CloudFront
- A CDN
  - Content Delivery Network
- Meant for inceasing performance / reducing latency for accessing files

### Origin
The central source of truth for your content

### Edge Locations
- The distributed global network of servers storing chaches of your content
- content is pushed from the origin and cached in the edge locations
- for sending content to users with lower latency

If client cannot find content at an edge location
- it will look at the origin
- request is forwarded over AWS global network not internet
  - higher performance

---

### Distribution

The entity created in CloudFront for managing CDN

A distrubiton
- has an endpoint
  - for example - `d1msoloriokf92kfk.cloudfront.net`
- an origin
  - holding files
  - can specify many origins

Allows for
- faster delivery of static and dynamic content
- media files
- CRUD on objects
- submitting data via web form
- streaming of real time events

Can configure
- path patterns
  - determine which origin to be sourced from
- Cache policy
  - determine for how long data is cached at edge locations

---

## CloudFront Caching and Behaviors

#### Regional Edge Caches
- Sit between region and Edge locations
- Can cache more content than edge locations
- 12 Regional Edge Caches globally

---

#### Edge Location
- 210 Edge locations
- a point of presence
  - where Users initially connects to distribution

#### How Caching Works
- User first attemps to find content at Edge Location
- All traffic from that point goes over AWS global network
  - low latency
- If not found goes to Regional Edge Cache
- If not found goes to Region
- Region returns content
  - caching content in
    - Regional Edge Cache
    - Edge Location
    - content is cached for 24 hours by default
  - return to user

### TTL (Time to Live)
- defaults to 24 hours
- decreasing TTL
  - better for dynamic content
  - content you expect to change often
- increasing TTL
  - better performance
  - reduces load on origin

- Can set a maximum and a default TTL
- Can define different TTLs for different file types
- After cache expires
  - CloudFront checks origin to see if file is latest version
  - repaces cache with updated version

Can control Cache with header
- Cache-Control - `max-age=<seconds>`
- specifies how long until CloudFront gets object again from origin
- Expires - sets expiration date and time

### CloudFront Path Patterns

Can direct client requests based on path patterns
- for example
  - requests for *.jpg to Origin1
  - requests for *.mp4 to Origin2

### Caching Based on Request Headers

[Common exam question]

## Signed URLs

- A URL for accessing a file
- used to provide control over access to content

Used for
- individual files
- clients that don't support cookies

Can specify
- beginning date and time
- expiration date and time
- IP address ranges of users

Steps
- mobile device
  - authenticates to app
  - requests signed URL for object
- App returns signed URL
- mobile device uses signed URL to access object on CloudFront distribution
- CloudFront distribution returns object

---

## CloudFront Signed Cookies

- used to control/provide access to multiple restricted files
- similar to signed cookies
- used when you don't want to change URLs

---

## CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI)

[Common exam question]

- Used to restrict access to a CloudFront Origin S3 Bucket to only the CloudFront distribution network
- Stops clients from accessing the S3 bucket directly
- OAI not used with EC2 origins

Steps
- client requests file from CloudFront using cloudFront URL
- CloudFront requests file from origin using **OAI**

### To Restrict Access for EC2 origins
- use security group on instance
- only accepts incoming traffic from IP addresses for the CloudFront network
- AWS publishes list of CloudFront IPs
- must be updated

---

## AWS WAF Web ACL

- **WAF** - Web Applicaiton Firewall
- Can create **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** and attach to **CloudFront**
- Allows for preventing known melicious attacks at the edge nodes

---

## Exercise - CloudFront Cache and Behavior Settings

In S3 console
- create 2 buckets
- both in US East 1
- named origin1 and origin2
- upload .mp4 file in one bucket
- upload .jpg file in other bucket

Create Distribution
- In CloudFront Console
- create distribution
- choose origin1 as origin
- Restrict bucket Access - Use OAI
- Create new Itentity
- Yes, Update bucket policy
- Viewer Protocol policy - HTTP and HTTPS
- Price class - US, Canada, and Europe only
- Create

Test access to distribution
- get URL for created distribution
- in browser
  - `<distribution-url>/<file-name>`

Add an origin to Distribution
- In distributions console
- create an origin
  - origin2
  - restrict bucket access
  - Create new identity
  - Yes, Update bucket policy

Inspect Bucket Policy
- CloudFront updated policy
- policy allows
  - CloudFront distribution
  - to perform s3:GetObject
  - on this bucket

Direct traffic to buckets based on file extension
- Create Behavior
- path pattern - *.jpg
- set origin to bucket with .jpg file
- create

Explore other tabs in Distribution window
- can configure an error page
- can restrict or whitelist requests by country

clean up
- disable distribution
  - takes several minutes
- once disabled, delete

## CloudFront SSL/TLS

Can use an SSL/TLS certificate with CloudFront
- issue with AWS Certificate Manager
- attach to CloudFront Distribution
- Certificate must be issued in us-east-1 if being issued by ACM
- Can also import 3rd party certificate

Can use custom domain name for CloudFront distribution
- using CNAME records

Origins can have their own SSL/TLS certificates
- encrypt traffic from CloudFront to the origin

S3 comes with it's own SSL/TLS certificate

**origin certificates must be public certificates**

---

## Field Level Encryption

Provides additional layer of encryption end-to-end from CloudFront edge to destination.

- Commonly used to allow users to upload sensitive data via CloudFront
  - PII
- Can only be decrypted by authorized applications
- Uses public key cryptography
  - public key used to encrypt data at edge
  - private key used at destination to decrypt

---

## Server Name Indication (SNI)
- within a distribution
  - can have multiple SSL/TLS certificates corrosponding to different domains names
  - domain names run on the same IP address
- SNI works with browsers released after 2010
  - otherwise need dedicated IP addresses for each domain name

---

## Lambda@Edge

Can run Lambda functions at the CloudFront level to execute functions closer to viewer

Can be Node.js and Python

Can be run at these points
- after CF receives requests from viewer
- before CF forwards request to origin
- After CF receives response from origin
- Before CF forwards response to viewer

## AWS Global Accelerator

Increases performance by directing clients via the AWS global network instead of the internet



Steps
- A user connects to an Edge location close to them
- The users request is then directed to region that has the lowest latency

#### Global Accelerator vs CloudFront
- Global Accelerator
  - increases performance 
  - increases resiliency / availability
  - costs money

- CloudFront
  - increases performance by caching static and dynamic content
  - saves money

## Exercise - Create Global Accelerator

#### What we're building
- in 2 different regions
  - Setting up load balancer
  - directing to 1 EC2 instance
- both regions connected to Global Accelerator
  - registers IP addresses for both load balancers
- test by connecting to Global Accelerator
- simulate a failure in one instance and test if we are redirected

#### Steps

Prerequisite
- Completed Route 53 exercise where set up index.txt file housing html content to be copied down by EC2 instance

Create instance
- in region close to you
- user data
  - displays AZ for instance - from ASG lesson
- security group
  - HTTP
  - SSH

Check instance by IP

Create Load Balancer
- ALB
- HTTP listener
- select AZs EC2 instance is located in
- Add-on services
  - create a global accelerator
- Create target group
  - Add target
  - Health Checks
  - healthy threshold - 2

Test load balancer by DNS name

Switch to Sydney Region

Create instance and load balancer with same steps as above
- No need to create another global accelerator

Add second ALB to Global Accelerator
- In Global Accelerator Console
- Click in listener
- Add endpoint group
- Choose region - Syndey

Update Health Checks for Global Accelerator
- for each endpoint
- configure health check threshold

Test Global Accelerator
- Get DNS for Global Accelerator

similate a failure in the region you were allocated to
- edit inbound rules
  - remove HTTP for EC2 instance
- In Target Groups
  - should see target becomes unhealthy

Test Global Accelerator
- should get other instance

Clean up
- Disable Global Accelerator
- delete Global Accelerator
- Delete ALBs
- terminate instances
