# DNS, Caching, and Performance Optization

## Route 53
- route 53 is a DNS server
- hosted zone represents a set of records belonging to a domain

Steps to connect
- client types domain in browser
- request makes its way to Route 53
- Route 53 returns IP for domain
- client makes request for IP

---

#### Domain Registration

#### Hosted Zone
Sets up a hosted zone for domain

#### Health Checks
Can configure health checks with Route 53 to be run on EC2 instances

#### Traffic Flow
Gives fine control on how to send traffic to various IP addresses

## Exercise - Register Domain with Route 53

[Already did this]

---

## Route 53 Hosted Zones

A file with a set of records

#### Records
indicates how a domain can be resolved

A record can have a Time to Live (TTL) set
- how long the browser will cache the response IP from the DNS for that domain before reaching out to DNS again
- if TTL is too long and something changes
  - clients could try to connect to old IP

---

## Private Hosted Zone

Can create a private hosted zone associated with a VPC

Can use any domain names you want because they are private to VPC

hosted zone has a records table that routes to private IP address

On VPC must enable
- Hostnames
- DNS Resolution

---

## Migrating Hosted Zones

You can
- migrate hosted zones from another DNS provider
- migrate your hosted zones to another registrar / DNS provider
- migrate your hosted zone to another AWS account

- associate a hosted zone with a VPC in another account
  - Steps
    - 1). Authorize assiation with VPC in second account
    - 2). Create an association in the second account

## Routing Policies (with Route 53)

---

## Simple
provides the IP address associated with a domain name



---

## Failover
[Common Exam Question]
- Initially directs all traffic to primary IP
- if primary IP becomes unhealthy
  - then directs traffic to next IP in the list
- Combined with health checks

---

## Geolocation
uses client's geographic location to send IP for closest region

- Checks what global geolocation zone a client maps to
  - if a record exists for that zone
    - direct client to associated IP
  - otherwise send to default IP 


---

## Goeproximity
Directs client to the closest region within a geographic area

---

## Latency
[Common Exam Question]
- Directs client based on lowest latency route to a resource
- Can be combined with Health checks

---

## Multivalue Answer
- cycles through several IP addresses
- can be combined with health checks so Route 53 only returns healthy records
- can function as a basic load balancer

#### Weighted
Routes based on relative weights assigned to resources

- Can create multiple records with same domain pointing to different IPs
- each IP given a different weight
- Can be used for A/B testing

- Can be combined with Health checks

## Exercise - Using Route 53 Routing Policies

Launch 2 EC2 instances
- in different regions far from each other
- add user data
  - displays webpage showing AZ
- store public IPs for each instance for later use

Create A record for each instance
- value is IP address
- routing policy - Latency
- choose region
- give a human readable Record ID

Test clients from different location
- Use VPN to change location
- See which instance you get returned
- should get instance closest to client

Clean up
- delete A records 
- terminate instances
