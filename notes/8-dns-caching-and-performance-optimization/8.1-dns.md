# DNS and Route 53

## Route 53 Cheat Sheet

https://digitalcloud.training/amazon-route-53/

---

## Route 53
- route 53 is a DNS server
- hosted zone represents a set of records belonging to a domain
- Route 53 is located alongside all Edge Locations

Steps to connect
- client types domain in browser
- request makes its way to Route 53
- Route 53 returns IP for domain
- client makes request for IP

---

#### Domain Registration

#### Hosted Zone
Sets up a hosted zone for domain

#### Health Checks
Can configure health checks with Route 53 to be run on EC2 instances

#### Traffic Flow
Gives fine control on how to send traffic to various IP addresses

## Exercise - Register Domain with Route 53

[Already did this]

---

## Route 53 Hosted Zones

A file with a set of records

#### Records
indicates how a domain can be resolved

A record can have a Time to Live (TTL) set
- how long the browser will cache the response IP from the DNS for that domain before reaching out to DNS again
- if TTL is too long and something changes
  - clients could try to connect to old IP

---

## Private Hosted Zone

Can create a private hosted zone associated with a VPC

Allows for not exposing DNS records

Can use any domain names you want because they are private to VPC

hosted zone has a records table that routes to private IP address

On VPC must enable
- enableDnsHostname
- enableDnsSupport - enables DNS resolution

---

## Migrating Hosted Zones

You can
- migrate hosted zones from another DNS provider
- migrate your hosted zones to another registrar / DNS provider
- migrate your hosted zone to another AWS account

- associate a hosted zone with a VPC in another account
  - Steps
    - 1). Authorize assiation with VPC in second account
    - 2). Create an association in the second account

Can transfer domains to route 53 if top level domain is supported (ie. .com)

Transfer domain from Route 53 to other registrar by contacting AWS

## Routing Policies (with Route 53)

---

## Simple
provides the IP address associated with a domain name



---

## Failover
[Common Exam Question]
- Initially directs all traffic to primary IP
- if primary IP becomes unhealthy
  - then directs traffic to next IP in the list
- Combined with health checks

---

## Geolocation
uses client's geographic location to send IP for closest region

- Checks what global geolocation zone a client maps to
  - if a record exists for that zone
    - direct client to associated IP
  - otherwise send to default IP 


---

## Goeproximity
Directs client to the closest region within a geographic area

---

## Latency
[Common Exam Question]
- Directs client based on lowest latency route to a resource
- Can be combined with Health checks

---

## Multivalue Answer
- cycles through several IP addresses
- can be combined with health checks so Route 53 only returns healthy records
- can function as a basic load balancer

#### Weighted
Routes based on relative weights assigned to resources

- Can create multiple records with same domain pointing to different IPs
- each IP given a different weight
- Can be used for A/B testing

- Can be combined with Health checks
---

## Exercise - Using Route 53 Routing Policies

Launch 2 EC2 instances
- in different regions far from each other
- add user data
  - displays webpage showing AZ
- store public IPs for each instance for later use

Create A record for each instance
- value is IP address
- routing policy - Latency
- choose region
- give a human readable Record ID

Test clients from different location
- Use VPN to change location
- See which instance you get returned
- should get instance closest to client

Clean up
- delete A records 
- terminate instances

## Route 53 Resolver

#### DNS Resolver
Allows a DNS server to forward DNS request downstream to other DNS servers to resolve IP for a domain

Allows for connecting an on-premise DNS server to Route 53
- either for
  - resolving requests from EC2 instances to on-premise DNSs
  - resolving requests from client to Route 53 via an on-premise data center

#### DNS Resolver - Outbound Endpoint
- On-premise data center and VPC are connected with VPN connection
- An EC2 instance makes a request for a domain name that can only be resolved by an on-premise DNS
- It attempts to resolve domain name with Route 53
- Route 53 directs request to Outbound Endpoint (exists in VPC)
- Outbound Endpoint directs request to on-premise DNS server
- DNS server resolves domain to private IP and sends to EC2 instance

[See slide]

---

#### Inbound Endpoint

- On-premise data center and VPC connected with VPN
- A client in on-premise data center makes request for domain that can only be resolved by Route 53
- Client attempts to resolve with on-premise DNS
- On-premise DNS forwards to inbound endpoint on VPC
- inbound inpoint forwards to Route 53 where domain is resolved

---

## CNAME

[Common Exam Question]

CNAME
- Route 53 charges for CNAME queries
- Can create a CNAME record to point a subdomain to the zone Apex
  - www.example.com --> example.com
- Can point to any DNS record that is hosted anywhere

---

## Alias

- Route 53 doesn't charge for alias queries to AWS resources
- Alias record can only point to
  - CloudFront distribution
  - EB
  - ELB
  - S3 as a static website
  - another record in same hosted zone
