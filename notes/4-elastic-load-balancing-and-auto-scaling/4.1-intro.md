## Elasticity - Scaling Up vs Out

Scalability
- ability to add resources to accomodate more load

Elasticity
- ability to add and remove resources to accommodate changing load

### Scaling Up - Vertical Scaling
- Add resource to a single instance
- weakness - there is still a single point of failure

### Scaling Out - Horizontal Scaling
- provides more resiliency
- can scale to unlimited capacity

---

## EC2 Auto Scaling

Elasticly horizontally scale EC2 instances

- can launch and terminate instances dynamically

- can replace instance if it goes offline
- can trigger adding / removing instances based on cloudWatch metrics
  - if average CPU hits certain threshold

**Scaling Policy** - defines how to respond to changes in demand

**Launch Template** - specifies configuration of EC2 instances to be launched by ASG.

**Launch config** - can also specify configuration for ASG, however, launch template provides more option.

Creating a Auto Scaling Group
- Choose launch template
- configure purchase option
  - on demand
  - spot
  - resevered
  - combination
- Choose VPC and subnets
  - ASG must live within single VPC
- Can attach a load balancer

---

## Health Checks

#### EC2 status checks
  - enabled by default with ASG

#### ELB Health checks
  - can be used in addition to EC2 status checks with an ASG
  - recommended to enable EBL health checks if load balancer is being used

#### Health Check Grace Period
- how long to wait before checking health status of instance
- auto scaling waits until grace period completes to launch or terminate instances

#### Group Metrics
- data about ASG
- 1 minute granularity
- no charge
- must be enabled

#### Basic Monitoring
- instances individually sending metrics to CloudWatch
- 5 minute granularity

#### Detailed Monitoring
- instances individually sending metrics to CloudWatch
- 1 minute granularity
- charge applied

#### Cooldowns
- prevent auto scaling from launching or terminating before effects of previous activities have been applied
- defaults to 5 minutes

#### Termination policy
- determines which instances to terminate first on scale-in event

#### Termination Pretection
- can protect certain instances from being terminated

#### Standby State
- puts instance from `InService` state to `Standby` state to update or troubleshoot instance
- [look into further]

#### Lifecycle Hooks
- perform custom actions when ASG launches or terminates an instance 
  - for example
    - run script to install software after instance launches
    - pull data metrics from instance before it is terminated

**Warm Pool** - a set of instances already activated ready to handle traffic

## Exercise - Create Auto Scaling Group

- Create Launch Template
  - Amazon Linux 2 AMI
  - t2.micro instance
  - add key pair
  - add SSH access
  - advanced details
    - Add user data
      - found in provided code in 'Auto Scaling and ELB'
      - writes the AZ of the instance to index.html file

- Create Auto Scaling Group
  - select launch template
  - select public subnets
  - enable group metrics with CloudWatch
  - set group size
    - desired - 2
    - minimun - 2
    - maximum - 4

- Explore ASG console
  - details
  - activity
  - automatic scaling
  - instnace management
  - monitoring
  - instance refresh

clean up
- leave instances running for next exercise

---

## Load Balancing and High Aailability

High Availability
- if an instance goes down, traffic can be directed to different instance
- instances spread across AZs application has high availability

---

## Types of Elastic Load Balancers

#### Application Load Balancer
- Operates at the request level / HTTP / layer 7
- targets can include IP addresses, instances, Lambda Fxns, or containers
- can route based on
  - HTTP headers
  - path
  - host
  - query string parameter
  - source IP address
- does not support static IP addresses as target nodes
- source IP in `x-forwarded-for` header

#### Network Load Balancer
- Operates at connection level / Layer 4
- Targets can be IP addresses, and instances
- listens on
  - TCP
  - TLS
  - UDP
  - TCP_UDP
- Routes based on IP protocol data
- ultra high performance
- low latency
- TLS offloading
  - processing encryption for TLS connections
- does support static IP addresses as target nodes
  - good for whitelisting and firewalls
- source IP native in IP protocol data

#### Classic Load Balancer
- Not on the exam
- depricated
- performs on layer 4 and 7
- used for existing applications running in EC2-classic

#### Gateway Load Balancer
- used in front of virtual appliances
  - firewalls
- operates at layer 3
[see slide for more information]

---

### Load Balancer Type Use Cases

Application Load Balancer
- Web apps with L7 routing (HTTP/HTTPS)
- microservices architecture (docker containers)
- lambda targets

Network Load Balancer
- TCP and UDP based applications
- ultra-low latency
- static IP addresses as targets

Gateway Load Balancer
- Can load balancer virtual appliances
  - intrusion detection systems (IDS)
  - intrusion prevention systems (IPS)
  - next generation firewalls (NGFW)
  - Web application firewalls (WAF)
  - distributed denial of service protection systems (DDoS)
- can use with ASGs
- Can apply network monitoring and logging for analytics

## Routing with ALB and NLB

ALB
- Routing based on HTTP path and host
- [see slides]

NLB
- Routed based on IP protocol data
- Routing based on port number
- NLBs nodes can have elastic IPs for each subnet
- [see slides]

---

## Exercise - Create Target Groups

Creating 2 target groups - one for ALB and NLB each

- Create target group for ALB
  - select HTTP
  - set healthy threshold - 2
    - number of consequitive successful health checks before instance considered healthy
  - don't add any instances

- Create target group for NLB
  - protocol TCP (routes traffic based on TCP)
  - keep port at 80 (NLB sends traffic to HTTP server on instance)
  - don't add any instances

---

## Network Load Balancer

Allocate 3 Elastic IPs

Create Network Load balancer
  - choose same availability zones as ASG
    - will place a load balancer node in each subnet
    - assign an elastic IP for each subnet node
  - add listener for TCP forwarding to TG-NLB

Explore load balancer console and actions
  - features:
    - can allocate an s3 bucket to store logs
    - an enable cross zone load balancing

Add target group (TG-NLB) to ASG
- Edit ASG
- choose Load balancers
- select TG

See what IP addresses are associated with Load Balancer
- in terminal run `nslookup`
- paste in DNS name of NLB
- Can see
  - IP for load balancer
  - 3 Elastic IP addresses associated with load balancer nodes

paste NLB DNS name into browser

paste in elastic IPs into browser


Clean up
- delete load balancer
- delete TG-NLB
- release elastic IPs

---

## Exercise - Application Load Balancer

- Remove TG-NLB and add TG-ALB to Auto Scaling Group

- Create Application Load Balancer
  - Set HTTP as protocol
  - Add TG-ALB target group
  - set subnets
    - IP addressed will be assigned by AWS

- Visit DNS name for ALB

---

## Exercise - ALB - Query String Routing

- Launch instance
  - Attach to subnet that is included in TG-ALB
  - Security group
    - HTTP, SSH
  - Label 'Query Test'

- Create new target group
  - name - TG-ALB-2
  - protocol - HTTP
  - Add Query Test instance

in ALB

Add query string rule A to existing listener
  - key: `AppGroup`, value: `A`
  - forward to TG-ALB

Add query string rule B to existing listener
  - key: `AppGroup`, value: `B`
  - forward to TG-ALB-2

Clean Up
- Terminate Query String instance

---

## EC2 Scaling Policies

#### Target Tracking Scaling Policy
- dynamic scaling policy
- ASG scales to try to meet a target metric
  - for example keep ASGAvergaeCPUUtilization = 60%

#### Simple Scaling
- Set an alarm
  - for example CPU >= 60%
- when an alarm triggered ASG launch or terminate instances


#### Step Scaling
- set an alarm
  - for example CPU >= 60%
- trigger launch or terminating instances depending on how large the alarm breach is
  - for example
    - if CPU > 60% launch some instances
    - if CPU > 90% launch more instances

#### Schedule Scaling
- Define a time for scaling ASG

#### Predictive Scaling
- AWS uses traffic history to predict how and when to scale elasticly

---

## Exercise - Elasticly Scale Application

Create scaling policy for ASG
- target tracking
- average CPU utilization
- target 60%

#### SSH into both instances and generate load

Enable the EPEL repo:
- `sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y`

Install the stress utility
- `sudo yum install stress -y`

Generate load on instance
`stress -c 6`

---

## Cross-Zone Load Balancing

If enabled
- Balances load so that each target instance gets equal amount of traffic

If disabled
- balances load evenly accross load balancer nodes (one node per subnet)

[see diagram]

- always enabled for ALBs
- disabled by default with NLBs and GLBs

---

## Session State and Session Stickiness

Occasionally session state needs to be stored in the application

#### Storing session data
- session data such as if a user is logged in needs to be stored
- can be stored in
  - dynamoDB
  - ElastiCache

#### Sticky Sessions
When user visits application
- load balancer assigns cookie to client
- cookie used to associate client with an instance
- allows session data to be stored on the instance
- if instance goes offline, client is assigned another instance

---

## Exercise - Enable Sticky Sessions

- visit DNS name for ALB in browser
  - observe browser cycling through instances

Edit target group
- enable stickiness
- leave with load balancer generated cookie

Load Balancer Generated Cookie
- cookie name is `aws-alb`

application-based cookie
- allows you to name to cookie what you want
- could be beneficial if you have multiple layers of load balancing in architecture

visit DNS name for ALB in browser
- notice we are stuck to one instance

Clean Up
- Disable sticky sessions

---

## Secure Listener for ELB

Load Balancers can handle SSL/TLS encryption of traffic to application

Can Create a SSL/TLS certificate with AMC

SSL/TLS certificate can be attached to load balancer
- Traffic can be encrypted
  - from client to load balancer
  - and then from load balancer to instance

SSL/TLS certificate can be attached to instances while using NLB
- Traffic can be encrypted
  - from client to instance
  - load balancer doesn't decrypt and re-encrypt

---

## Exercise - Create a Secure Listener

Prerequisite
- have domain name registered with Route 53
- have ALB created routing traffic to target group
- have ASG with target group registered

Navigate to Certificate Manager Console
- Request certificate
- add purchased domain
- use DNS validation

Navigate to Load Balancer Console
- Select ALB
- Add listener
  - HTTPS on port 443
  - forward traffic to target group
  - select created certificate

Add DNS record for ALB
- In Route 53 select hosted zone
- add record
  - zone apex (no subdomain)
  - alias for ALB

For security group
- Add rule for HTTPS

in browser visit
https://your-domain.com

Clean Up
- Delete A record pointing to ALB for hosted zone

---

## Clean Up

Delete
- ASG
  - should terminate instances
- ALB (paid)
- Release IP address (paid)
- Target Groups
