## IAM Cheat Sheet
https://digitalcloud.training/certification-training/aws-solutions-architect-associate/security-identity-compliance/aws-iam/

---

Performing any task on AWS is done by triggering an **Action**

In order to perform that action the user or application must be authorized to do so.

Authorization is given via a policy

A policy can be attached to a user

---

- Users

- Groups
  - way of organizing users

- Policies
  - gives permissions to
    - user
    - group
    - role

- Roles
  - a role is assumed by a resource. The resource then assumes the policies attached to that role

Every account as an ARN - amazon resource name

---

### Types of authentication for each connection type

- console
  - username / password

- SDK / CLI
  - access keys

---

## Policies

- Identity based policy
  - can be assigned to users, groups, or roles

- Resource based policy
  - can be assigned directly to a resource

---

### IAM role

Trust policy
- describes who can assume role
  - which resources, users, groups

permissions policy
- describes actions available on policy

### AWS Security Token Service (STS)

- Provides temporary credentials to a resource, user, group
- allows the resource to assume role for short amount of time
 
- used with
  - Identity federation
  - delegation
  - cross-account access
  - IAM roles

---

## Identity Based Policy vs Resource Based Policy

### Identity Based Policy
- attached to a user, group, or role
- control actions identity can perform
- permissions policy is an identity based policy

Inline policy
  - 

Managed Policy
  -

---

### Resource based policy
- attached to a resource (s3 bucket, or EC2 instance)
- grants the specified principal (a user) permissions to perform specific actions on that resource
- Trust policy is an example of a resource based policy

---

## IAM Policy Structure

```json
{
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "effect", // Allow / Deny
    "Action": "action", // the action being allowed
    "Resource": "arn", // the entity being granted permissions to
    "Condition": { // optional, used for fine control
      "condition": {
        "key": "value"
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

When you see an entry for principal, that indicates it is a resource based policy

```json
{
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "AWS": "*"
    },
    "Action": [
      "elasticfilesystem:ClientRootAccess",
      "elasticfilesystem:ClientMount",
      "elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite"
    ]
  }]
}
```

## Hands On Lab

- Access Policy Simulator
  - choose user
  - choose EC2 as service
  - select all actions
  - run simulation
  - we have access to all actions in list

- Create a user with less privelages
  - attach existing policy directly
  - `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess`

- Return to Policy Simulator
  - see new user
  - choose EC2 service
  - select all actions
  - run simulation
  - many actions denied

---

## IAM best practices

- lock away AWS account root user access keys
  - or even delete them
- create individual IAM users and use those users
- use groups to assign permissions to IAM users
- principal of least privilege
  - only grant permissions needed
- start by using AWS managed policies
  - rather than writing your own
  - rather than inline policies
- configure strong password policy for users
- Enable MFA

- have EC2 instance assume role rather than having them store access keys
- do not share access keys among users
- **rotate credentials regularly**
- use policy conditions for extra security
- Regularly monitor activity in AWS account
