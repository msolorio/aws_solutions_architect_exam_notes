## Exercise - Create Organization and Add Accounts

In AWS Organization Console
- Create an organization
- current logged in user becomes the management account
  - becomes the paying account for the organization
- check email varification for organization

Add AWS account
  - give name - production-account
  - give email address - cannot be same as used for root account
  - give IAM role name
    - `OrganizationAccountAccessRole`

Create organizational unit
- click root > actions > organization unit > create new
- call production

move production-account into production organizational unit

---
## Service Control Policies (SCP)

Can control maximum available permissions available in an account

SCPs do not grant permissions. Account must still have permission assigned to them by IAM

Root account / management account has SCP attached to it that allows any action on any resource

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "*",
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

#### Tag Policy
- enforces tag standardization in organization

---

## Exercise - Create Service Control Policy

Switch from management account to production-account

From organization console
- copy production account number
- paste into 'Switch Roles.txt' file
- update display name

- from top right dropdown > switch roles

Onced logged in
- navigate to IAM
- create role
- add permissions
  - AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
  - AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess
- call DenyRoleModificationTest

Once created
- copy role ARN
- paste in DenyAccessToASpecificRole.json file under resource entry
  - will deny access to listed actions for the specified resource (the role we just created)

Switch back to management account
- in organization console
- go to policies
- enable service control policies

AWS organization uses a deny list strategy
- The FullAWSAccess SCP is defined at the top level and flows down the hierarchy
- you must add deny list SPCs where needed in hierarchy

in Service Control policies
- create a policy
  - paste in code from DenyAccessToASpecificRole.json file
  - give name
  - create policy

Attach to production organizational unit
- select production OU > policies > attach
- attach deny policy

Those permission will now be restricted to any accounts in OU

Switch to production account
- try to attach a policy
  - AmazonRDSFullAccess
- notice we are denied
- try to remove one of the attached policies
- notice we are denied

Try creating another role 
- able to create a new role

production-account cannot modify permissions for `DenyRoleModificationTest`

Switch back to management account
- in organization console
  - detach role
  - role will no longer be applied
